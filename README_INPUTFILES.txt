Hi There!

When using the Codon Usage Tabulator, please convert the genomic *.gbff and *.fna files into *gbk and *.fasta files for the organisms you wish to analyze using CUT and CUT visualizer and store them in the FASTA_src and GBK_src directories in the Genbank_Organism directory after running Genbank_Retrieve.ipynb!
