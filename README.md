Hi There!

This is a simple readme designed to get you onboarded quickly with CUT!

In order to run CUT, you will first need to pull down prokaryotic organisms using 
Genbank_Retrieve.ipynb, a python Jupiter notebook that allows you to pull down a large
Number of organisms in a easy to use script

Next, read the README_INPUTFILES.txt on how to properly format and store input files for CUT

Finally, You will need to run CUT_MAIN.r, which will dynamically generate the codon usage tabulations and visualizations in an easy to view manner

 Lead Developer, CUT
